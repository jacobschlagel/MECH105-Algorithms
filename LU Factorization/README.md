# LU Factorization
The luFactor2 function performs LU factorization on a inputted square matrix.
It factors matrix A, into an upper triangular matrix, U, and a lower triangular matrix, L by using Gauss Elimination.
The algorithm also keeps track of the pivot matrix. LU factorization is a handy technique, because it allows for 
other linear algebra tasks to be doable.

### Inputs
   * A=square matrix

### Outputs
   * L=lower triangular matrix
   * U=upper triangular matrix
   * P=pivot matrix

# MECH105-Algorithms
All of the numerical method algorithms I have created throughout the MECH105 course can be found here. The following functions carry out the following:

   1. False Position
   2. LU Factorization
   3. Simpson's 1/3 Rule

## False Position
The *falsePosition* function estimates the roots of an inputted function.

## LU Factorization
The *luFactor2 function* finds the upper and lower triangular matrices, as well as the corresponding pivot matrix of any inputted square matrix.

## Simpson's 1/3 Rule
The *Simpson* function uses Simpson's 1/3 method to estimate the integral of data.

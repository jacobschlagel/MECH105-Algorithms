# Simpson's 1/3 Rule
The Simpson function uses the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to calculate the integral of inputted data. The 1/3 rule only
works with data that has an odd amount of data points, and therefore an even number of intervals. If there is an 
odd number of intervals, a single trapezoidal rule will be used to evaluate the last interval.

### Inputs
   * x=array of x values
   * y=array of y values
   
### Outputs
   * I=Integral
